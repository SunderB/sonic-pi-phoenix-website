## Synth or FX long name
## ====================
# A word or short phrase that is used as a label for the synth or FX.
name = "Ping Pong Echo"

## Synth or FX usage example
## ====================

## Synth or FX description
## ====================
# The detailed description of the synth or FX.
doc = '''
Echo FX with each delayed echo swapping between left and right channels. Has variable phase duration (time between echoes) and feedback (proportion of sound fed into each echo). If you wish to have a phase duration longer than 1s, you need to specify the longest phase duration you'd like with the arg max_phase. Be warned, `:ping_pong` FX with very long phases can consume a lot of memory and take longer to initialise. Also, large values for feedback will cause the echo to last for a very long time.

Note: sliding the `phase:` opt with `phase_slide:` will also cause each echo during the slide to change in pitch, in much the same way that a sample's pitch changes when altering its rate.

## Synth or FX introduction
## ====================
# The label describing the version of Sonic Pi in which this synth or FX first appeared.
["ping_pong".introduced]
label = "Introduced in v3.2"

## Synth or FX options
## ====================
# The options are the opts of this synth or FX.
# In the documentation, we currently display two tables of opts:
# - one listing the name of each opt and its default value for easy reference
# - a second, more detailed table labelled 'Options', containing:
#   - the name of each opt
#   - a detailed description of it
#   - its default value
#   - (if the opt has constraints (limits or a specific range of permitted
#     values, etc)): the constraints of the opt.
#     Example:
#     contraints = '''
#     Must be zero or greater
#     '''
#   - a label describing whether this opt can be modulated (altered) while the
#     synth or fx is running
#   - (if the opt is slidable): a label indicating that the opt is slidable.
#     Example:
#     slidable_label = "Has slide options to shape changes"
#   - (if the opt is affected by the current BPM): a label indicating that the opt is scaled with the current BPM.
#     Example:
#     bpm_scaled_label = "Scaled with current BPM value"

The amount (percentage) of the original signal that is fed into the internal FX system as a value between 0 and 1. With a pre_mix: of 0 the FX is completely bypassed unlike a mix: of 0 where the internal FX is still being fed the original signal but the output of the FX is ignored. The difference between the two is subtle but important and is evident when the FX has a residual component such as echo or reverb. When switching mix: from 0 to 1, the residual component of the FX's output from previous audio is present in the output signal. With pre_mix: there is no residual component of the previous audio in the output signal.

Starting position of sound in the stereo field. With headphones on, this means how much of the sound starts in the left ear, and how much starts in the right ear. With a value of -1, the sound starts completely in the left ear, a value of 0 starts the sound equally in both ears, and a value of 1 starts the sound completely in the right ear. Values in between -1 and 1 move the sound accordingly. Each echo will swap between left and right at the same distance away from 0 (the centre) that this `pan_start:` opt is set to. For example, with a value of -1, the sound starts completely in the left ear, and the echoes after this will swap between fully right and fully left (1 and -1). With a value of 0, since the sound starts in the centre of the stereo field, each echo also stays in the centre, meaning the panning effect is cancelled out.
