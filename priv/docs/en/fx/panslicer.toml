## Synth or FX name
## ====================
# A unique identifier for this synth or FX.
["panslicer"]

## Synth or FX long name
## ====================
# A word or short phrase that is used as a label for the synth or FX.
name = "Pan Slicer"

## Synth or FX usage example
## ====================
# A basic code example of how to use the synth or FX.
usage = '''

## Synth or FX description
## ====================
# The detailed description of the synth or FX.
doc = '''
Slice the pan automatically from left to right. Behaves similarly to slicer and wobble FX but modifies stereo panning of sound in left and right speakers. Default slice wave form is square (hard slicing between left and right) however other wave forms can be set with the `wave:` opt.
'''

## Synth or FX introduction
## ====================
# The label describing the version of Sonic Pi in which this synth or FX first appeared.
["panslicer".introduced]
label = "Introduced in v2.6"

## Synth or FX options
## ====================
# The options are the opts of this synth or FX.
# In the documentation, we currently display two tables of opts:
# - one listing the name of each opt and its default value for easy reference
# - a second, more detailed table labelled 'Options', containing:
#   - the name of each opt
#   - a detailed description of it
#   - its default value
#   - (if the opt has constraints (limits or a specific range of permitted
#     values, etc)): the constraints of the opt.
#     Example:
#     contraints = '''
#     Must be zero or greater
#     '''
#   - a label describing whether this opt can be modulated (altered) while the
#     synth or fx is running
#   - (if the opt is slidable): a label indicating that the opt is slidable.
#     Example:
#     slidable_label = "Has slide options to shape changes"
#   - (if the opt is affected by the current BPM): a label indicating that the opt is scaled with the current BPM.
#     Example:
#     bpm_scaled_label = "Scaled with current BPM value"

The difference between the two is subtle but important and is evident when the FX has a residual component such as echo or reverb. When switching mix: from 0 to 1, the residual component of the FX's output from previous audio is present in the output signal. With pre_mix: there is no residual component of the previous audio in the output signal.
