# This is a data file that contains information describing the text that is
# displayed on pages in the Lang section of Sonic Pi's help panel.

## Function name
## ====================
# A unique identifier for this function.
["set_recording_bit_depth!"]

## Function summary
## ====================
# A short phrase describing this Sonic Pi function.
summary = "Set the bit depth for recording wav files"

## Function description
## ====================
# The detailed description of this function.
doc = '''
When you hit the record button, Sonic Pi saves all the audio you can hear into a wav file. By default, this file uses a resolution of 16 bits which is the same as CD audio and good enough for most use cases. However, when working with professional equipment, it is common to want to work with even higher quality files such as 24 bits and even 32 bits. This function allows you to switch the default from 16 to one of 8, 16, 24 or 32.

## Function args
## ====================
# Args are the required parameters for the function. Each arg has two documented
# properties:
# - the arg's name
# - the arg's type (number, integer, symbol, ...).
# Example:
# (Repeat the following for every arg):
# [[chord.args]]
# name = "tonic"
# type = "symbol"

[["set_recording_bit_depth!".args]]
name = "bit_depth"
type = "number"

## Function introduction
## ====================
# The label describing the version of Sonic Pi in which this function first appeared.
["set_recording_bit_depth!".introduced]
label = "Introduced in v2.11"

## Function options
## ====================
# The options are the optional parameters of this function.
# Each option has two documented properties:
# - the option's name
# - the option's description doc.
# Example:
# [chord.options]
# label = "Options"

# Now repeat the following for every option:
# [[chord.options.list]]
# name = "invert:"
# doc = '''
# Apply the specified num inversions to chord. See the fn `chord_invert`.
# '''

## Function examples
## ====================
# Each function may have one or more examples. If it has any, they are listed
# under an overall 'Example' or 'Examples' label (heading), and each example has
# a numbered sub-heading.
# Example:
# [chord.examples]
# label = "Example"
# label_plural = "Examples"

# Now repeat the following for every example:
# [[chord.examples.list]]
# label = "Example 1"
# example = '''
# puts (chord :e, :minor) # returns a ring of midi notes - (ring 64, 67, 71)
# '''
["set_recording_bit_depth!".examples]
label = "Example"
label_plural = "Examples"

[["set_recording_bit_depth!".examples.list]]
label = "Example 1"
