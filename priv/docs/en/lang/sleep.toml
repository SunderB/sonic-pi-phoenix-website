## Function name
## ====================

# A short phrase describing this Sonic Pi function.
summary = "Wait for beat duration"

## Function description
## ====================
# The detailed description of this function.
doc = '''
Wait for a number of beats before triggering the next command. Beats are converted to seconds by scaling to the current bpm setting.
'''

## Function args
## ====================
# Args are the required parameters for the function. Each arg has two documented
# properties:
# - the arg's name
# - the arg's type (number, integer, symbol, ...).
# Example:
# (Repeat the following for every arg):
# [[chord.args]]
# name = "tonic"
# type = "symbol"

[["sleep".args]]
name = "beats"
type = "number"

## Function introduction
## ====================
# The label describing the version of Sonic Pi in which this function first appeared.
["sleep".introduced]
label = "Introduced in v2.0"

## Function options
## ====================
# The options are the optional parameters of this function.
# Each option has two documented properties:
# - the option's name
# - the option's description doc.
# Example:
# [chord.options]
# label = "Options"

# Now repeat the following for every option:
# [[chord.options.list]]
# name = "invert:"
# doc = '''
# Apply the specified num inversions to chord. See the fn `chord_invert`.
# '''

## Function examples
## ====================
# Each function may have one or more examples. If it has any, they are listed
# under an overall 'Example' or 'Examples' label (heading), and each example has
# a numbered sub-heading.
# Example:
# [chord.examples]
# label = "Example"
# label_plural = "Examples"

# Now repeat the following for every example:
# [[chord.examples.list]]
# label = "Example 1"
# example = '''
# puts (chord :e, :minor) # returns a ring of midi notes - (ring 64, 67, 71)
# '''
["sleep".examples]
label = "Example"
label_plural = "Examples"

[["sleep".examples.list]]
label = "Example 1"
example = '''

  # Without calls to sleep, all sounds would happen at once:

  play 50  # This is actually a chord with all notes played simultaneously
  play 55
  play 62

  sleep 1  # Create a gap, to allow a moment's pause for reflection...

  play 50  # Let's try the chord again, but this time with sleeps:
  sleep 0.5 # With the sleeps, we turn a chord into an arpeggio
  play 55
  sleep 0.5
  play 62
'''

[["sleep".examples.list]]
label = "Example 2"
example = '''

  # The amount of time sleep pauses for is scaled to match the current bpm. The default bpm is 60. Let's double it:

  use_bpm 120
  play 50
  sleep 1 # This actually sleeps for 0.5 seconds as we're now at double speed
  play 55
  sleep 1
  play 62

  # Let's go down to half speed:

  use_bpm 30
  play 50
  sleep 1 # This now sleeps for 2 seconds as we're now at half speed.
  play 55
  sleep 1
  play 62
