# This is a data file that contains information describing the text that is
# displayed on pages in the Lang section of Sonic Pi's help panel.

## Function name
## ====================
# A unique identifier for this function.
["play_chord"]

## Function summary
## ====================
# A short phrase describing this Sonic Pi function.
summary = "Play notes simultaneously"

## Function description
## ====================
# The detailed description of this function.
doc = '''
Play a list of notes at the same time.

Accepts optional args for modification of the synth being played. See each synth's documentation for synth-specific opts. See `use_synth` and `with_synth` for changing the current synth.
'''

## Function args
## ====================
# Args are the required parameters for the function. Each arg has two documented
# properties:
# - the arg's name
# - the arg's type (number, integer, symbol, ...).
# Example:
# (Repeat the following for every arg):
# [[chord.args]]
# name = "tonic"
# type = "symbol"

[["play_chord".args]]
name = "notes"
type = "list"

## Function introduction
## ====================
# The label describing the version of Sonic Pi in which this function first appeared.
["play_chord".introduced]
label = "Introduced in v2.0"

## Function options
## ====================
# The options are the optional parameters of this function.
# Each option has two documented properties:
# - the option's name
# - the option's description doc.
# Example:
# [chord.options]
# label = "Options"

# Now repeat the following for every option:
# [[chord.options.list]]
# name = "invert:"
# doc = '''
# Apply the specified num inversions to chord. See the fn `chord_invert`.
# '''

["play_chord".options]
label = "Options"

[["play_chord".options.list]]
name = "amp:"
doc = '''
The amplitude of the note
'''

[["play_chord".options.list]]
name = "amp_slide:"
doc = '''
The duration in beats for amplitude changes to take place
'''

[["play_chord".options.list]]
name = "pan:"
doc = '''
The stereo position of the sound. -1 is left, 0 is in the middle and 1 is on the right. You may use a value in between -1 and 1 such as 0.25
'''

[["play_chord".options.list]]
name = "pan_slide:"
doc = '''
The duration in beats for the pan value to change
'''

[["play_chord".options.list]]
name = "attack:"
doc = '''
Amount of time (in beats) for sound to reach full amplitude (attack_level). A short attack (i.e. 0.01) makes the initial part of the sound very percussive like a sharp tap. A longer attack (i.e 1) fades the sound in gently.
'''

[["play_chord".options.list]]
name = "decay:"
doc = '''
Amount of time (in beats) for the sound to move from full amplitude (attack_level) to the sustain amplitude (sustain_level).
'''

[["play_chord".options.list]]
name = "sustain:"
doc = '''
Amount of time (in beats) for sound to remain at sustain level amplitude. Longer sustain values result in longer sounds. Full length of sound is attack + decay + sustain + release.
'''

[["play_chord".options.list]]
name = "release:"
doc = '''
Amount of time (in beats) for sound to move from sustain level amplitude to silent. A short release (i.e. 0.01) makes the final part of the sound very percussive (potentially resulting in a click). A longer release (i.e 1) fades the sound out gently.
'''

[["play_chord".options.list]]
name = "attack_level:"
doc = '''
Amplitude level reached after attack phase and immediately before decay phase
'''

[["play_chord".options.list]]
name = "decay_level:"
doc = '''
Amplitude level reached after decay phase and immediately before sustain phase. Defaults to sustain_level unless explicitly set
'''

[["play_chord".options.list]]
name = "sustain_level:"
doc = '''
Amplitude level reached after decay phase and immediately before release phase.
'''

[["play_chord".options.list]]
name = "env_curve:"
doc = '''
Select the shape of the curve between levels in the envelope. 1=linear, 2=exponential, 3=sine, 4=welch, 6=squared, 7=cubed
'''

[["play_chord".options.list]]
name = "slide:"
doc = '''
Default slide time in beats for all slide opts. Individually specified slide opts will override this value
'''

[["play_chord".options.list]]
name = "pitch:"
doc = '''
Pitch adjustment in semitones. 1 is up a semitone, 12 is up an octave, -12 is down an octave etc.  Decimal numbers can be used for fine tuning.
'''

[["play_chord".options.list]]
name = "on:"
doc = '''
If specified and false/nil/0 will stop the synth from being played. Ensures all opts are evaluated.
'''

## Function examples
## ====================
# Each function may have one or more examples. If it has any, they are listed
# under an overall 'Example' or 'Examples' label (heading), and each example has
# a numbered sub-heading.
# Example:

# label = "Example"
# label_plural = "Examples"

# Now repeat the following for every example:
# [[chord.examples.list]]
# label = "Example 1"
# example = '''
# puts (chord :e, :minor) # returns a ring of midi notes - (ring 64, 67, 71)
