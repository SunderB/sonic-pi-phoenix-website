## Synth or FX description
## ====================
# The detailed description of the synth or FX.
doc = '''
Versatile wobble FX. Will repeatedly modulate a range of filters (rlpf, rhpf) between two cutoff values using a range of control wave forms (saw, pulse, tri, sine). You may alter the phase duration of the wobble, and the resonance of the filter. Combines well with the dsaw synth for fun dub wobbles. Cutoff value is at cutoff_min at the start of phase

label = "Introduced in v2.0"

## Synth or FX options
## ====================
# The options are the opts of this synth or FX.
# In the documentation, we currently display two tables of opts:
# - one listing the name of each opt and its default value for easy reference
# - a second, more detailed table labelled 'Options', containing:
#   - the name of each opt
#   - a detailed description of it
#   - its default value
#   - (if the opt has constraints (limits or a specific range of permitted
#     values, etc)): the constraints of the opt.
#     Example:
#     contraints = '''
#     Must be zero or greater
#     '''
#   - a label describing whether this opt can be modulated (altered) while the
#     synth or fx is running
#   - (if the opt is slidable): a label indicating that the opt is slidable.
#     Example:
#     slidable_label = "Has slide options to shape changes"
#   - (if the opt is affected by the current BPM): a label indicating that the opt is scaled with the current BPM.
#     Example:
#     bpm_scaled_label = "Scaled with current BPM value"

The amount (percentage) of the original signal that is fed into the internal FX system as a value between 0 and 1. With a pre_mix: of 0 the FX is completely bypassed unlike a mix: of 0 where the internal FX is still being fed the original signal but the output of the FX is ignored. The difference between the two is subtle but important and is evident when the FX has a residual component such as echo or reverb. When switching mix: from 0 to 1, the residual component of the FX's output from previous audio is present in the output signal. With pre_mix: there is no residual component of the previous audio in the output signal.
