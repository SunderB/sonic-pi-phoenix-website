doc = '''
Sends a MIDI pitch bend message to *all* connected devices on *all* channels. Use the `port:` and `channel:` opts to restrict which MIDI ports and channels are used.

Delta value is between 0 and 1 with 0.5 representing no pitch bend, 1 max pitch bend and 0 minimum pitch bend.

Typical MIDI values such as note or cc are represented with 7 bit numbers which translates to the range 0-127. This makes sense for keyboards which have at most 88 keys. However, it translates to a poor resolution when working with pitch bend. Therefore, pitch bend is unlike most MIDI values in that it has a much greater range: 0 - 16383 (by virtue of being represented by 14 bits).

* It is also possible to specify the delta value as a (14 bit) MIDI pitch bend value between 0 and 16383 using the `delta_midi:` opt.
* When using the `delta_midi:` opt no pitch bend is the value 8192

## Function args
## ====================
# Args are the required parameters for the function. Each arg has two documented
# properties:
# - the arg's name
# - the arg's type (number, integer, symbol, ...).
# Example:
# (Repeat the following for every arg):
# [[chord.args]]
# name = "tonic"
# type = "symbol"

[["midi_pitch_bend".args]]
name = "delta"
type = "float01"

## Function introduction
## ====================
# The label describing the version of Sonic Pi in which this function first appeared.

label = "Introduced in v3.0"

## Function options
## ====================
# The options are the optional parameters of this function.
# Each option has two documented properties:
# - the option's name
# - the option's description doc.
# Example:
# [chord.options]
# label = "Options"

# Now repeat the following for every option:

## Function examples
## ====================
