doc = '''
Creates lo-fi output by decimating and deconstructing the incoming audio by lowering both the sample rate and bit depth. The default sample rate for CD audio is 44100, so use values less than that for that crunchy chip-tune sound full of artefacts and bitty distortion. Similarly, the default bit depth for CD audio is 16, so use values less than that for lo-fi sound.

# The options are the opts of this synth or fx.
# In the documentation, we currently display two tables of opts:

# - a second, more detailed table labelled 'Options', containing:
#   - the name of each opt
#   - a detailed description of it
#   - its default value
#   - (if the opt has constraints (limits or a specific range of permitted
#     values, etc)): the constraints of the opt
#   - a label describing whether this opt can be modulated (altered) while the
#     synth or fx is running
#   - (if the opt is slidable): a label indicating that the opt is slidable

Any parameter that is slidable has three additional options named _slide,
slide_curve, and _slide_shape.  For example, 'amp' is slidable, so you can also
