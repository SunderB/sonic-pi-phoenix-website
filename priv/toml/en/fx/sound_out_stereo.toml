## Synth or FX long name
## ====================
# A word or short phrase that is used as a label for the synth or FX.

## Synth or FX description
## ====================
# The detailed description of the synth or FX.
doc = '''
Outputs a two-channel stereo signal to two consecutive soundcard outputs of your choice. By default will route the left and right channels of the incoming stereo signal (generated within the FX block) into separate left and right output channels. However, with the `mode:` opt, it is possible to alternatively cross over the channels or mix the incoming stereo channels into a single mono output and duplicate that on both left and right output channels.

## Synth or FX introduction
## ====================
# The label describing the version of Sonic Pi in which this synth or FX first appeared.
["sound_out_stereo".introduced]
label = "Introduced in v3.0"

## Synth or FX options
## ====================
# The options are the opts of this synth or FX.
# In the documentation, we currently display two tables of opts:
# - one listing the name of each opt and its default value for easy reference
# - a second, more detailed table labelled 'Options', containing:
#   - the name of each opt
#   - a detailed description of it
#   - its default value
#   - (if the opt has constraints (limits or a specific range of permitted
#     values, etc)): the constraints of the opt.
#     Example:
#     contraints = '''
#     Must be zero or greater
#     '''
#   - a label describing whether this opt can be modulated (altered) while the
#     synth or fx is running
#   - (if the opt is slidable): a label indicating that the opt is slidable.
#     Example:
#     slidable_label = "Has slide options to shape changes"
#   - (if the opt is affected by the current BPM): a label indicating that the opt is scaled with the current BPM.
#     Example:
#     bpm_scaled_label = "Scaled with current BPM value"

The amount (percentage) of the original signal that is fed into the internal FX system as a value between 0 and 1. With a pre_mix: of 0 the FX is completely bypassed unlike a mix: of 0 where the internal FX is still being fed the original signal but the output of the FX is ignored. The difference between the two is subtle but important and is evident when the FX has a residual component such as echo or reverb. When switching mix: from 0 to 1, the residual component of the FX's output from previous audio is present in the output signal. With pre_mix: there is no residual component of the previous audio in the output signal.

## Sample sliding

slide_label = "Slide Options"
slide_description = '''
Any parameter that is slidable has three additional options named _slide,
_slide_curve, and _slide_shape.  For example, 'amp' is slidable, so you can also
set amp_slide, amp_slide_curve, and amp_slide_shape with the following effects:
'''

[["sound_out_stereo".sliding.slide_opts]]
name = "_slide"
default = "0"
doc = '''
Amount of time (in beats) for the parameter value to change. A long parameter_slide value means that the parameter takes a long time to slide from the previous value to the new value. A parameter_slide of 0 means that the parameter instantly changes to the new value.
'''

[["sound_out_stereo".sliding.slide_opts]]
name = "_slide_shape"
default = "5"
doc = '''
Shape of curve. 0: step, 1: linear, 3: sine, 4: welch, 5: custom (use *_slide_curve: opt e.g. amp_slide_curve:), 6: squared, 7: cubed. 
'''

[["sound_out_stereo".sliding.slide_opts]]

doc = '''
Shape of the slide curve (only honoured if slide shape is 5). 0 means linear and positive and negative numbers curve the segment up and down respectively.
