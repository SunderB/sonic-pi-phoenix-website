## Synth or FX name
## ====================
# A unique identifier for this synth or FX.
["gverb"]

## Synth or FX long name
## ====================
# A word or short phrase that is used as a label for the synth or FX.
name = "GVerb"

## Synth or FX usage example
## ====================
# A basic code example of how to use the synth or FX.
usage = '''
with_fx :gverb do

end
'''

## Synth or FX description
## ====================
# The detailed description of the synth or FX.
doc = '''
Make the incoming signal sound more spacious or distant as if it were played in a large room or cave. Similar to reverb but with a more spacious feel.
'''

## Synth or FX introduction
## ====================
# The label describing the version of Sonic Pi in which this synth or FX first appeared.
["gverb".introduced]
label = "Introduced in v2.9"

## Synth or FX options
## ====================
# The options are the opts of this synth or FX.
# In the documentation, we currently display two tables of opts:
# - one listing the name of each opt and its default value for easy reference
# - a second, more detailed table labelled 'Options', containing:
#   - the name of each opt
#   - a detailed description of it
#   - its default value
#   - (if the opt has constraints (limits or a specific range of permitted
#     values, etc)): the constraints of the opt.
#     Example:
#     contraints = '''
#     Must be zero or greater
#     '''
#   - a label describing whether this opt can be modulated (altered) while the
#     synth or fx is running
#   - (if the opt is slidable): a label indicating that the opt is slidable.
#     Example:
#     slidable_label = "Has slide options to shape changes"
#   - (if the opt is affected by the current BPM): a label indicating that the opt is scaled with the current BPM.
#     Example:
#     bpm_scaled_label = "Scaled with current BPM value"

The amount (percentage) of the original signal that is fed into the internal FX system as a value between 0 and 1.

The difference between the two is subtle but important and is evident when the FX has a residual component such as echo or reverb. When switching mix: from 0 to 1, the residual component of the FX's output from previous audio is present in the output signal. With pre_mix: there is no residual component of the previous audio in the output signal.

slide_description = '''
Any parameter that is slidable has three additional options named _slide,
_slide_curve, and _slide_shape.  For example, 'amp' is slidable, so you can also
set amp_slide, amp_slide_curve, and amp_slide_shape with the following effects:

Amount of time (in beats) for the parameter value to change. A long parameter_slide value means that the parameter takes a long time to slide from the previous value to the new value. A parameter_slide of 0 means that the parameter instantly changes to the new value.
