# The detailed description of this function.
doc = '''
In music we build chords from scales. For example, a C major chord is made by taking the 1st, 3rd and 5th notes of the C major scale (C, E and G). If you do this on a piano you might notice that you play one, skip one, play one, skip one etc. If we use the same spacing and start from the second note in C major (which is a D), we get a D minor chord which is the 2nd, 4th and 6th notes in C major (D, F and A). We can move this pattern all the way up or down the scale to get different types of chords. `chord_degree` is a helper method that returns a ring of midi note numbers when given a degree (starting point in a scale) which is a symbol `:i`, `:ii`, `:iii`, `:iv`, `:v`, `:vi`, `:vii` or a number `1`-`7`. The second argument is the tonic note of the scale, the third argument is the scale type and finally the fourth argument is number of notes to stack up in the chord. If we choose 4 notes from degree `:i` of the C major scale, we take the 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th notes of the scale to get a C major 7 chord.

## Function args
## ====================
# Args are the required parameters for the function. Each arg has two documented
# properties:
# - the arg's name
# - the arg's type (number, integer, symbol, ...).
# Example:
# (Repeat the following for every arg):
# [[chord.args]]
# name = "tonic"
# type = "symbol"

[["chord_degree".args]]
name = "degree"
type = "symbol_or_number"

[["chord_degree".args]]
name = "tonic"
type = "symbol"

[["chord_degree".args]]
name = "scale"
type = "symbol"

## Function introduction
## ====================
# The label describing the version of Sonic Pi in which this function first appeared.
["chord_degree".introduced]
label = "Introduced in v2.1"

## Function options
## ====================
# The options are the optional parameters of this function.
# Each option has two documented properties:
# - the option's name
# - the option's description doc.
# Example:
# [chord.options]
# label = "Options"

# Now repeat the following for every option:

## Function examples
## ====================
# Each function may have one or more examples. If it has any, they are listed
# under an overall 'Example' or 'Examples' label (heading), and each example has
# a numbered sub-heading.
# Example:
# [chord.examples]
# label = "Example"
# label_plural = "Examples"

# Now repeat the following for every example:
# [[chord.examples.list]]
# label = "Example 1"
# example = '''
