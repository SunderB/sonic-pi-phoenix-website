# This is a data file that contains information describing the text that is
# displayed on pages in the Lang section of Sonic Pi's help panel.

## Function name
## ====================
# A unique identifier for this function.
["pitch_to_ratio"]

## Function summary
## ====================
# A short phrase describing this Sonic Pi function.
summary = "Relative MIDI pitch to frequency ratio"

## Function description
## ====================
# The detailed description of this function.
doc = '''
Convert a midi note to a ratio which when applied to a frequency will scale the frequency by the number of semitones. Useful for changing the pitch of a sample by using it as a way of generating the rate.
'''

## Function args
## ====================
# Args are the required parameters for the function. Each arg has two documented
# properties:
# - the arg's name
# - the arg's type (number, integer, symbol, ...).
# Example:
# (Repeat the following for every arg):
# [[chord.args]]
# name = "tonic"
# type = "symbol"

[["pitch_to_ratio".args]]
name = "pitch"
type = "midi_number"

## Function introduction
## ====================
# The label describing the version of Sonic Pi in which this function first appeared.
["pitch_to_ratio".introduced]
label = "Introduced in v2.5"

## Function options
## ====================
# The options are the optional parameters of this function.
# Each option has two documented properties:
# - the option's name
# - the option's description doc.
# Example:
# [chord.options]
# label = "Options"

# Now repeat the following for every option:
# [[chord.options.list]]
# name = "invert:"
# doc = '''
# Apply the specified num inversions to chord. See the fn `chord_invert`.
# '''

## Function examples
## ====================
# Each function may have one or more examples. If it has any, they are listed
# under an overall 'Example' or 'Examples' label (heading), and each example has
# a numbered sub-heading.
# Example:
# [chord.examples]
# label = "Example"
# label_plural = "Examples"

# Now repeat the following for every example:
# [[chord.examples.list]]
# label = "Example 1"
# example = '''
# puts (chord :e, :minor) # returns a ring of midi notes - (ring 64, 67, 71)
# '''
["pitch_to_ratio".examples]
label = "Example"
label_plural = "Examples"

[["pitch_to_ratio".examples.list]]
label = "Example 1"

'''

[["pitch_to_ratio".examples.list]]
label = "Example 2"

'''

[["pitch_to_ratio".examples.list]]
label = "Example 3"
example = '''

'''

[["pitch_to_ratio".examples.list]]
label = "Example 4"
example = '''
sample :ambi_choir, rate: pitch_to_ratio(3) # Plays :ambi_choir 3 semitones above default.
'''

[["pitch_to_ratio".examples.list]]
