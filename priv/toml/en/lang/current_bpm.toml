This can be set via the fns `use_bpm`, `with_bpm`, `use_sample_bpm` and `with_sample_bpm`.

# '''

## Function examples
## ====================
# Each function may have one or more examples. If it has any, they are listed
# under an overall 'Example' or 'Examples' label (heading), and each example has
# a numbered sub-heading.
# Example:
# [chord.examples]
# label = "Example"
# label_plural = "Examples"

# Now repeat the following for every example:
# [[chord.examples.list]]
# label = "Example 1"
# example = '''
# puts (chord :e, :minor) # returns a ring of midi notes - (ring 64, 67, 71)
# '''
["current_bpm".examples]
label = "Example"
label_plural = "Examples"

[["current_bpm".examples.list]]
label = "Example 1"
example = '''

  use_bpm 60
  puts current_bpm_mode    # => 60
  use_bpm 70
  puts current_bpm_mode    # => 70
  use_bpm :link
  puts current_bpm_mode    # => 120 (or whatever the current Link BPM value is)
