doc = '''
Specify new default values to be used by all subsequent calls to `sample` within the `do`/`end` block.  Merges the specified values with any previous sample defaults, rather than replacing them. After the `do`/`end` block has completed, the previous sampled defaults (if any) are restored.

# properties:
# - the arg's name

# Example:
# (Repeat the following for every arg):
# [[chord.args]]
# name = "tonic"
# type = "symbol"

## Function introduction
## ====================
# The label describing the version of Sonic Pi in which this function first appeared.
["with_merged_sample_defaults".introduced]
label = "Introduced in v2.9"

## Function options
## ====================
# The options are the optional parameters of this function.
# Each option has two documented properties:
# - the option's name
# - the option's description doc.
# Example:
# [chord.options]
# label = "Options"

# Now repeat the following for every option:
# [[chord.options.list]]
# name = "invert:"
# doc = '''
# Apply the specified num inversions to chord. See the fn `chord_invert`.
# '''

## Function examples
## ====================
# Each function may have one or more examples. If it has any, they are listed
# under an overall 'Example' or 'Examples' label (heading), and each example has
# a numbered sub-heading.
# Example:
# [chord.examples]
# label = "Example"
# label_plural = "Examples"

# Now repeat the following for every example:
# [[chord.examples.list]]
# label = "Example 1"
# example = '''
# puts (chord :e, :minor) # returns a ring of midi notes - (ring 64, 67, 71)
# '''
