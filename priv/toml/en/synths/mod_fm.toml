## Synth or FX description
## ====================
# The detailed description of the synth or FX.
doc = '''
The FM synth modulating between two notes - the duration of the modulation can be modified using the mod_phase arg, the range (number of notes jumped between) by the mod_range arg and the width of the jumps by the mod_width param. The FM synth is a sine wave with a fundamental frequency which is modulated at audio rate by another sine wave with a specific modulation, division and depth. Useful for generating a wide range of sounds by playing with the `:divisor` and `:depth` params. Great for deep powerful bass and fun 70s sci-fi sounds.

label = "Introduced in v2.0"

## Synth or FX options
## ====================
# The options are the opts of this synth or FX.
# In the documentation, we currently display two tables of opts:
# - one listing the name of each opt and its default value for easy reference
# - a second, more detailed table labelled 'Options', containing:
#   - the name of each opt
#   - a detailed description of it
#   - its default value
#   - (if the opt has constraints (limits or a specific range of permitted
#     values, etc)): the constraints of the opt.
#     Example:
#     contraints = '''
#     Must be zero or greater
#     '''
#   - a label describing whether this opt can be modulated (altered) while the
#     synth or fx is running
#   - (if the opt is slidable): a label indicating that the opt is slidable.
#     Example:
#     slidable_label = "Has slide options to shape changes"
#   - (if the opt is affected by the current BPM): a label indicating that the opt is scaled with the current BPM.
#     Example:
#     bpm_scaled_label = "Scaled with current BPM value"
