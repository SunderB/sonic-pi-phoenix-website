## Synth or FX description
## ====================
# The detailed description of the synth or FX.
doc = '''
An addition to the :bass_foundation synth inspired by the sounds of the 80s. Use them together if you want to give it a rough, slurping, or gargling component. Adapted for Sonic Pi from [Steal This Sound](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/supercollider/supercollider/develop/examples/demonstrations/stealthissound.scd).

## Synth or FX introduction
## ====================
# The label describing the version of Sonic Pi in which this synth or FX first appeared.

label = "Introduced in v4.0"

## Synth or FX options
## ====================
# The options are the opts of this synth or FX.
# In the documentation, we currently display two tables of opts:
# - one listing the name of each opt and its default value for easy reference
# - a second, more detailed table labelled 'Options', containing:
#   - the name of each opt
#   - a detailed description of it
#   - its default value
#   - (if the opt has constraints (limits or a specific range of permitted
#     values, etc)): the constraints of the opt.
#     Example:
#     contraints = '''
#     Must be zero or greater
#     '''
#   - a label describing whether this opt can be modulated (altered) while the
#     synth or fx is running
#   - (if the opt is slidable): a label indicating that the opt is slidable.
#     Example:
#     slidable_label = "Has slide options to shape changes"
#   - (if the opt is affected by the current BPM): a label indicating that the opt is scaled with the current BPM.
#     Example:
#     bpm_scaled_label = "Scaled with current BPM value"

Any parameter that is slidable has three additional options named _slide,
_slide_curve, and _slide_shape.  For example, 'amp' is slidable, so you can also
set amp_slide, amp_slide_curve, and amp_slide_shape with the following effects:
